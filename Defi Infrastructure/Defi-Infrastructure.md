## Let's Start with the basics ( Very Important ) ‚≠ê‚ú≥


### What do we mean by Decentralized Finance ü§®
Before moving to Decentralized finance first understand Centralized Finance, In CEFI (Centralized finance) your Hard Earned money is held by banks, corporations whose end goal is to make money. The financial system is full of third parties (mediators) who facilitate money movement between parties, with each one charging fees for using their services. 
For example, say you purchase your keyboard using your credit card. The charge goes from the merchant to an acquiring bank, which forwards the card details to the credit card network.

Decentralized finance eliminates intermediaries by allowing people, merchants, and businesses to conduct financial transactions through emerging technology. This is accomplished through peer-to-peer financial networks that use security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements.

Decentralized Finance uses this technology to eliminate centralized finance models by enabling anyone to use financial services anywhere regardless of who or where they are.

DeFi applications give users more control over their money through personal wallets and trading services that cater to individuals.



### How Does Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Works ü§®
Decentralized finance uses the blockchain technology that cryptocurrencies use. A blockchain is a distributed and secured database or ledger. Applications called dApps are used to handle transactions and run the blockchain.




### Future of DeFi ü§®
Decentralized finance is still in the beginning stages of its evolution. For starters, it is unregulated, which means the ecosystem is still riddled with infrastructural mishaps, hacks, and scams.
The goal of DeFi is to get rid of the third parties that are involved in all financial transactions.
