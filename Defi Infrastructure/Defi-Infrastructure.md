# Defi Infrastructure

## Let's Start with the basics ( Very Important ) ‚≠ê‚ú≥


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What do we mean by Decentralized Finance üìî
Before moving to Decentralized finance first understand Centralized Finance, In CEFI (Centralized finance) your Hard Earned money is held by banks, corporations whose end goal is to make money. The financial system is full of third parties (mediators) who facilitate money movement between parties, with each one charging fees for using their services. 
For example, say you purchase your keyboard using your credit card. The charge goes from the merchant to an acquiring bank, which forwards the card details to the credit card network.

Decentralized finance eliminates intermediaries by allowing people, merchants, and businesses to conduct financial transactions through emerging technology. This is accomplished through peer-to-peer financial networks that use security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements.

Decentralized Finance uses this technology to eliminate centralized finance models by enabling anyone to use financial services anywhere regardless of who or where they are.

DeFi applications give users more control over their money through personal wallets and trading services that cater to individuals.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How Does Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Works ‚öí
Decentralized finance uses the blockchain technology that cryptocurrencies use. A blockchain is a distributed and secured database or ledger. Applications called dApps are used to handle transactions and run the blockchain.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Future of DeFi üîÆ
Decentralized finance is still in the beginning stages of its evolution. For starters, it is unregulated, which means the ecosystem is still riddled with infrastructural mishaps, hacks, and scams.
The goal of DeFi is to get rid of the third parties that are involved in all financial transactions.

## Evolution Of Finance :-

### Purpose Of Money 
 - **Unit Of Accounts** -> A Way to compare values of various goods and services.
 - **Medium Of Exchange** -> Allows non barter transaction.
 - **Store Of Value** -> Allows values to be retained.
 - **Transfer of Value** -> Ease of Transfer of value and to defer Value.


### Characterstics of Money
 - **Durability** -> Repeated Use (paper, gold)
 - **Portability** -> You Can Carry Around
 - **Divisibility** -> Fractional Units
 - **Uniformity** -> Versions of same currency have identical values
 - **Limited supply** -> Which makes it valuable.





## Problems with Centralized finance

1. Centralized Control :-
 - Centralized banking system is highly concentrated.
 - National central banks control currency
 - Non financial centralization of tech giants eg. Facebook, google, Amazon

2. Limited Access :-
 - Around 1.5 Billion peoples are unbanked.
 - Many enterpreneurs use credit card to finance their business. Since banks won't lend to them because they are small.

3. Inefficiency
 - Banks charges 3% for swiping through credit card.
 - 2 days settlement times for stock transactions.
 - Slow transfer of funds.
 - Many Frauds, chargeback.
 - Difficult to get paid.
 - Money is not secured.

4. Trust Issues
 - Very little transparency
 - Bank costumers don't know about the health of bank.
 - Banks have full control over the money.
  





## Foundation Of DeFi
The Core foundation of DeFi is Blockchain technology, Cryptographic hashing, cryptocurrency.

Let's Start With Blockchain

### What is Blockchain in Terms of DeFi ‚õì
Blockchain was invented by Haber and Stornetta in 1991, is basically a software protocol that allows multiple parties to operate under shared assumptions and data without trusting each other. 
 - These Data can be anything such as information of items in a supply chain or account balances of a token.
 - No one can temper with it because most of blockchains are open source.
 - Blockchain is not a bitcoin however Bitcoin uses the blockchain technology.
 - It's a distributed ledger: Blockchain is a ledger which is quickly and easily accessed by any person. It's distributed.
 - It's immutable: you can add anyting to blockchain but can't edit or delete it. 

### How public blockchain Works ü§º
 - Every Block contains a hashed reference to the block before it, So that you can trace every transaction all the way back to genesis block.
 - Cryptographic Security: Last Line (Hash) is repeated at the first line in the next block. This is why it is called chain of blocks. Altering any data in block 1, means the last line will change and will not match the first line in block 2.



 ### Hashing (Very important for DeFi) #Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ùá

 ** A Simple Hash **  
 Suppose i send an email to Steve Wazniak, However he needs to verify that what i sent him is exactly what he recieved.
  - Emails contains a single word "hello".
  - Encode the word (a=1, b=2, z = 26), so 8 5 12 12 15
  - Multiply number to get 86400
  - I post the hash on my website. after Steve Wazniak gets my email, She does the same hash and checks my website.
  - If the message was corrupted the hash will not match.
  - For Example the corrupted message is hallo instead of hello. So the hash will be completely different.
  - This is hash is little bit simple and causes a collison.


  ** SHA-256 (Secure Hashing Algorithm) **
  This algorithm is also used by bitcoin.
  - Hashing is a one way function.
  - Hashing is not a encryption because you can't decrypt.
  - The output of SHA-256 is 256 bits longer no matter how big or small is the input.

    ** Keccak-256 Algorithm **
  This algorithm is also used by ethereum.
  - Different hashing algorithm have different outputs from the SHA-256 for the same input.
