The Primary value add is creation of crypto-collatrized stablecoin, pegged to USD called DAI. This means the system can run completely from within the ethereum blockchain without relying on outside centralized banks and lending companies, Vault and audit the stable coin.

Two Token models are :-

1. DAI (Stable coin).
2. MKR (Governance Token).

**Governance**

- The MKR token (Governance token) controls the Maker DAO.
- Holders of the token have right to vote on protocol upgrades, including supporting new colletral types and tweaking parameters such as colletralization ratios.
- MKR holders are expected to make decision in the best financial interest of the platform.
- Their incentive is that healthy platform should increase the value of their share in the platform's governance.

**Decisions of MKR holders**

- Votes by the MKR holders can change any of the parameters available on the platform.
- The reward of receiving dividend would need to be weighed against any negative community response that might decrease the value of the protocol and MKR token.

**Why DAI is attractive**

- Users can purchase and utilize DAI without having to go through the process of generating in the vault. They can simply purchase DAI on an exchange.
- Users do not need to know the underlying mechanics of how DAI is created.
- Holders can easily earn the DAI savings rate by using the protocol.
- It is very easy to sell DAI and purchase an additional amount of the colletral asset to get levarage.

**Drawbacks of DAI** - DAI supply is always constrained by demands of ETH-Collatralized deby. - No clear loop exist to maintain the peg.
